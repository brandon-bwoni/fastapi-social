# Social App API Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Title
Social App API

### Description
This API, built using FastAPI, provides a backend solution for social applications with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It is designed to handle user accounts, posts, comments, likes, and other common features found in social media platforms. The API is fully tested, adheres to modern development practices, and is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind. It is ready for deployment on platforms like Heroku, Docker, and can integrate with CI/CD pipelines using Git.

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker (if containerizing the app)
- Git
- Heroku CLI (for Heroku deployment)

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd social-app-api
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=<database-connection-string>
   SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest
```

## 5. Deployment

### Heroku Deployment
1. **Login to Heroku CLI:**
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

2. **Create a Heroku App:**
   ```bash
   heroku create <app-name>
   ```

3. **Set Up Heroku Postgres Add-on:**
   ```bash
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   ```

4. **Push the Code to Heroku:**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

5. **Run Migrations on Heroku:**
   ```bash
   heroku run alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Docker Deployment
1. **Build Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t social-app-api .
   ```

2. **Run Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 social-app-api
   ```

### CI/CD with Git Pipelines
1. **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file with the following:
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build-and-test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.9'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r requirements.txt

         - name: Run tests
           run: pytest

     deploy:
       needs: build-and-test
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Deploy to Heroku
           run: |
             heroku container:login
             heroku container:push web --app <your-app-name>
             heroku container:release web --app <your-app-name>
   ```
